A minimum spend policy requires households to spend a designated percentage of their income and/or wealth in a given period of time. This policy applies progressively, and would replace tax either partially or entirely.
```
#### This House prefers a model of economic development that primarily relies upon microfinance as opposed to the development of traditional financial institutions

The ‘Green New Deal’ is a proposed economic stimulus package that aims to address climate change and economic inequality. It may include a living wage, a jobs guarantee, and 100% of power demand met by renewable energy. Within the current American political climate, it is seen as radical.
```

The practice and teaching of Confucianism was outlawed in China under the Maoist regime during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976. There has been a revival in China organically due to its rehabilitation by the Chinese Communist Party.
