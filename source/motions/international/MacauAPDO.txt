# Macau Asian Parliamentary Debate Open (Macau APDO)
## 3rd Macau APDO 2017
### R1: Sports
#### THBT all professional football leagues should implement a draft system.
```
A draft is a process used in some sports to allocate certain players to teams. In draft, teams take turns selecting from a pool of eligible players. When a team selects a player, the team receives exclusive rights to sign that player to a contract, and no other team in the league may sign the player.

To encourage parity, teams that do poorly in the previous season usually get to choose first in the postseason draft, sometimes with a “lottery” factor to discourage teams from deliberately losing.
```
