#### TH prefers a world where the app is available for public use.
```
There is an app that gives individuals access to quantitative data indicating how much fondness/dislike each other person they encounter feels towards them. This app works such that individuals with it open on their phone are able to see real-time changes in the index (e.g. if you are talking to a friend and say something that offends them, you are able to see the number drop). The index shown is not based on reported information, but is an accurate measure of the honest attitudes of the other person. For individuals to use the app to find out this information, they must consent to their ‘fondness rating’ being released to all other users of the app (i.e. for this to work, both individuals in question must have the app). The app itself does not store any data, and the base technology behind the app cannot be used for any other purposes.
