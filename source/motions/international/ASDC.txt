### R4: War
#### TH supports a ‘scorched earth policy’ approach in combatting ISIS
```
A scorched earth policy is a military strategy that targets anything that might be useful to the enemy while advancing through or withdrawing from an area. Specifically, all of the assets that are used or can be used by the enemy are targeted, such as food sources, transportation, communications, industrial resources, and even the people in the area. The practice can be carried out by the military in enemy territory, or in its own home territory. It may overlap with, but is not the same as, punitive destruction of the enemy’s resources, which is done for purely political reasons rather than strategic/operational reasons.

#### THW ban virtual reality applications that simulate real-life relationships (in both their positive and negative aspects)
#### THW allow individuals to cryogenically freeze themselves even if they are still alive.
```
Cryogenic freezing is a type of freezing which requires extremely low temperatures, generally below -2380 F (-1500 C). By using cryogenic freezing, it is possible in theory to keep an object frozen indefinitely without any “aging” related loss in the object. Generally, cryogenic freezing is used to freeze living objects. It is a process developed to safely freeze and thaw living objects so they can be revived to the exact condition they were in when they entered the freezing process.
```

Gawker and its spinoffs (Jezebel, Deadspin, etc.) are known for controversial click-friendly news, and has published content both good (such as synthesizing the accusations against Bill Cosby) and objectionable (such as the outing of celebrities).

Peter Thiel is a billionaire venture capitalist and hedgefund manager, who was outed in a Gawker article in Dec. 2007. He has since paid for lawsuits against Gawker, including the recent lawsuit by Terry Bollea (Hulk Hogan) which won the former wrestler $140 million.

These superheroes go about life helping save the world from just-as-absurd situations including aliens, artificial intelligence, and World War II era Nazis. The US government has called for a registration act that would reveal secret identities, powers, and places where they live, to hold super humans accountable.
